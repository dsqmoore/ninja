<h1>Ninja</h1>

<div id=content>
<p>Ninja is a small build system with a focus on speed.  It differs
from other build systems in two major respects: it is designed to have
its input files generated by a higher-level build system, and it is
designed to run builds as fast as possible.</p>

<p>Please see <a href='manual.html'>the extensive manual</a> for more
background, a philosophical  overview, and details about how Ninja
works.</p>

<h2>Installing</h2>

<pre>$ git clone git://github.com/martine/ninja.git
$ cat ninja/README</pre>

<h2>Mini-FAQ</h2>
<p><em>Q. Should my small software project use Ninja?</em><br>

A. Probably not.  For small numbers of input files (under 1000 or so)
Ninja's performance impact is unlikely to be noticeable, and there are
many other build systems that are more popular.  (If you were to ask
my opinion I'd prefer you
used <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_build_system'>autotools</a>
as everyone already knows how to build software that uses autotools.
It's really not that bad.)</p>

<p><em>Q. Should my large software project use Ninja?</em><br>

A. Maybe, if you are already expressing your build in some
higher-level description and generating project files.  But consider
using a meta-build system that already can target Ninja, such
as <a href='http://gyp.googlecode.com'>gyp</a>
or <a href='http://www.cmake.org/'>CMake</a>.</p>

<p><em>Q. Should my meta-build system target Ninja?</em><br>

A. Definitely.  It is easy to generate Ninja files.  Please ask for
help on the mailing list, and let us know when it works!</p>

<p><em>Q. Should my Windows project use Ninja?</em><br>

A. Ninja runs on Windows but it is still experimental.  We have yet to
see Ninja's performance claims proven.  It might be the case that
Ninja's design relies too much on <tt>stat()</tt> calls being
fast.</p>
